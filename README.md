## Genetic_Algo

A Genetic Algorithm is a simple method of approaching towards the solution by searching the entire Solution Space for an answer that best fits the problem at hand. 

Here, the Algorithm is used to find an amino acid sequence that aligns best with the given two sequences using the BLOSUM50 scoring matrix. Ten thousand iterations are performed and the sequence with the best score is selected at every iteration. 
The program has a runtime of about 4 minutes. The best sequence is presented as the output.
